## My process

### Built with

- BEM methodology
- CSS Flex
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I found out the CSS grid very straightforward and simple to use. (especially when you don't know much about CSS and layout!)

```css
display: grid;
grid-template-areas:
    ". header ."
    ". content ."
    ". attr .";
```

### Continued development

I want to keep focused on using CSS and Flexbox. I'm not (yet) completely comfortable with them, but I definitely like their simplicity :)

### Useful resources

- [BEM methodology resource](https://ru.bem.info/methodology/html/) - This helped me understand what BEM is and why it's cool.
- [A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This made me interested in CSS Grid and I personally liked it better than Flexbox.
